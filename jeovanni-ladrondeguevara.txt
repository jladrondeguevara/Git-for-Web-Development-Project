    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? Only once. It is specific to the element assigned.

For instance, if wanting to change the font in more than one pargraph, you can use a class attribute, to point to those paragraphs that you want the font changed. If there is only one specific paragraph that you want different font, you may use the ID attribute to point to only that paragraph.

    33. How do I remove a file via the command line? Why do I have to be careful with this?
    use "rm 'filename'"
    you have to be careful with this, because unlike the GUI, the command line doesnt ask for confirmation, nor sends the file to the recyling bin. So once its gone, its non retrievable.
    34. Why should I use version control? This allows you to go back and see every change you have done to a file. Easier to check different versions of a file.
    35. How often should I commit to github? Every time a change is done on the file. This helps keep a good record, and different versions of your files.

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? Block elements typically move to a new line, whereas the inline element stays put in the same line. An example is, div and span elements. Div is block element, therefore, when used it jumps to a new line. Span is an inline element. This, when used, will stay in the same line.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? It ignores the elements around it and positions itself on the top left corner.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model?
